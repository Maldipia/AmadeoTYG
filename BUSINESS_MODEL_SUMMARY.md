## 💰 Revenue Model

### Platform Fee Structure

| Payment Method | Customer Pays | Platform Earns | Merchant Gets |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **COD** | 100% of price | ₱0 (0%) | 100% of price |
| **GCash** | 97% of price (3% discount) | 2% of price | 95% of price |
| **Maya** | 97% of price (3% discount) | 2% of price | 95% of price |
| **Bank Transfer** | 97% of price (3% discount) | 2% of price | 95% of price |

### Example: ₱1,000 Order

**COD:**
- Customer pays: ₱1,000
- Platform earns: ₱0
- Merchant gets: ₱1,000

**GCash/Maya/Bank:**
- Customer pays: ₱970 (saves ₱30)
- Platform earns: ₱20 (5% - 3% discount)
- Merchant gets: ₱950

## 🚚 Delivery Model

### **Platform Does NOT Handle Delivery**

- Customers arrange delivery directly with riders
- Customers pay riders directly
- Platform charges **₱0** delivery fee
- Delivery cost is between customer and rider

### Why This Model?

1. **Flexibility** - Customers choose their preferred rider
2. **No Logistics** - Platform doesn't manage delivery fleet
3. **Lower Costs** - No delivery infrastructure needed
4. **Local Focus** - Customers use familiar local riders

---

## 🎁 Raffle Incentive System

### Purpose
Encourage online payments (which generate revenue) over COD (which generates ₱0)

### How It Works

**For Every Online Payment:**
- Customer gets 3% discount
- Customer gets 1 raffle entry
- Raffle entry valid for current month's draw

**For COD:**
- No discount
- No raffle entry
- No incentive

### Monthly Raffle Draw

**Prizes (Example):**
- 1x Staycation (₱3,000 value)
- 1x Original Shoes (₱1,500 value)
- 1x Apparel/Gift Certificate (₱500 value)

**Total Prize Pool:** ₱5,000/month

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Need 250 online payment orders to cover prizes
- At ₱1,000 average order: 250 × ₱20 = ₱5,000
- Any orders above 250 = pure profit
